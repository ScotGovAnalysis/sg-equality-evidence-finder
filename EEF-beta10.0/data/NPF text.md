**The National Performance Framework interactive dashboard is still in development and you may encounter errors.** 

In this dashboard you can access all of the data we hold on our National Indicators. To use this dashboard, you can use the menu below to select a National Outcome. Once selected, you will be able to select from a list of National Indicators that help us measure progress towards that National Outcome.
With a National Indicator selected, you will be able to explore the data we hold for that National indicator on an interactive chart and table. You can download the charts and the tables you produce via the 'Download chart' and 'Download table' buttons.
