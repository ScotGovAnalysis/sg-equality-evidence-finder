* The Inpatient Experience Survey is part of the Scottish Care Experience Survey Programme, a suite of national surveys asking about experiences of health services. The survey asks people about their experiences during a recent overnight stay in hospital. Variation in peoples’ experiences can be caused by a differences in local population characteristics, needs or geographical setting. Additional analysis of the survey results to examine the relationship between self-reported experience and a range of demographic and geographic characteristics has been undertaken. It should be noted that this analysis is not routinely carried out for every survey.
